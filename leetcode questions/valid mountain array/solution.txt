Given an array of integers arr, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.

Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]


Firstly, lets return false if length of array is less than 3. Then we should define tip and tipreached variables. After that
we iterate over the array and if two adjacent numbers are equal, we return false. if the upcoming element is bigger, then it becomes the
tip but we should also verify that tip was not reached. tip becomes reached if upcoming element is less than the current element 
and anything bigger than that tip will result in returning false. Also we should check if they array is not strictly ascending
or descending. we do this by checking if max value of an array is at the start or end of the array.
