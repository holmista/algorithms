This problem is rather simple. A palindrome is a combination of symbols(in our case only alphanumerics)
which can be read from left to right and from right to left the same way.

example: bob

Firstly we filter the input from all non alphanumeric characters and then we use pointer like approach.
We track the beginning and the end of the filtered string and iterate over it by moving pointers by one step.
On each iteration we check if both character are equal and if they are not we return false, otherwise true
once we exit the loop
