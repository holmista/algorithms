create a function which will compute the sum of array elements recursively. Array elements can be arrays themselves.

example

if the input is [1, 2, [3,4], [ 5, [6,7] ] ] the function should return 28

It is simple to compute sum of array elements using a for loop but when the elements are arrays, that makes the job harder.
We can't simply iterate over an array and sum elements up because if we try to add a numeric value to an array, there will be an error.
So, before summing up, we should determine whether the element is a numeric value or an array. If it is a numeric value, we simply
add it to our sum but if the element is an array, first we should sum up the array and only after that add that sum to our sum.
So if an element is an array, we call the same function we defined to solve this problem on that element and add that result to our sum.
The function itself will return a sum of array elements.
